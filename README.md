# Welcome to the CovEd Web Development Workshop!

To get started with making your own website, follow the instructions below!

## Installation

### Download Starter Code

First, you're going to need to download the starter code onto your computer. To do so, click the green "Code" button in the upper right hand corner of the screen, followed by "Download ZIP":

<br><br>

Once the download has completed, find where the .ZIP file is located on your computer and unzip it ([mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/zip-and-unzip-files-and-folders-on-mac-mchlp2528/mac)) ([windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/zip-and-unzip-files-f6dde0a7-0fec-8294-e1d3-703ed85e7ebc)).

### Download Code Editor

If you haven't already, you will need to download a code editor. We're going to be using Visual Studio Code in this workshop, which you can download here: https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

To make developing your website easier, we're also going to use a VS code extension called Live Server. You can install it by following the instructions [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).

## Running Your Code

If everything installed successfully, you can click on `Go Live` at the bottom of Visual Studio Code to launch a local server.
Try navigating to [http://localhost:5500/](http://localhost:5500/) to see the result!

<summary>Run into an error?</summary>
  
 - If you got an error like `npm command not found`, Node.js is probably not installed. Try following the instructions [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download) to install it. 
  
 - If you get an error like `command not found: http-server`, try running `sudo npm install http-server -g` and then trying again.
  
 - If you run into another error, or if those steps do not fix the error, please ask your instructor for help!
